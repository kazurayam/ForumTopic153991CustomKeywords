## What is this?

This is a small Katalon Studio project for a demonstration purpose. You can download a zip of this project from the [Releases](https://github.com/kazurayam/ForumTopic153991CustomKeywords/releases) page, unzip it, run it on your local Katalon Studio. I used Katalon Studio Free v10.0.0, which let us use the "Custom Keywords" feature in the Free version.

Why I created this?

In Katalon User forum, @ESTEBAN raised a post at
https://forum.katalon.com/t/why-cannot-i-call-a-customkeyword-from-scripts-groovy/153991

He asked a question:

>Do you know why we canâ€™t use CustomKeywords within Include > Scripts

I would explain my view as follows.
